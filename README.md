# Data_Science_Assessment
The purpose of this code is to explore the wine toy dataset from scikit learn, by use of data visualisations and applying machine learning algorithms.
The code is provided as a Jupyer Notebook and can be viewed in github itself
The first section of the code will load into the required packages, followed by exploration of the raw wine dataset. The rawdata will be arranged into a pandas DataFrame and the data will be cleaned to remove any major outliers. This will produce boxplots as outputs which will visualise the removal of outlier data.
The second section of the code will visualise the distribution of each of the classes of the wine data (classed in groups 0, 1 and 2) which are further grouped by the 13 different variables. The 13 different variables correlations will be visualised as a heatmap, and furthermore the distribution of variables for each group will be visualised by boxplots.
The last section of the dataset will compare the performance of machine learning algorithms to predict how well a particular wine (based on its 13 variables) can be classed into a particular group (0, 1 or 2). The machine learning algorithms used in this code are k-nearest neighbours, random forest classifier, support vector classifer and multi-layer perceptron classifier. The performance of each algorith will be ouput as a classification report, confusion matrix and an overall score.
